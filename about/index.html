<h1>ABOUT US </h1>
<br>
<p class="p">
We are a research group in Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology (IGDB), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). The lab is also affiliated to Centre of Excellence for Plant and Microbial Sciences (CEPAMS), established by CAS and John Innes Centre (JIC). By leveraging quantitative genetics and statistical genomics approaches, we are trying to pinpoint genetic control of important agronomic traits (e.g. yield, heterosis, nutritional value, disease resistance, etc) for crop improvement. 
</p>
<p class="p" style="text-indent:1cm">
Currently, we are working on wheat, which accounts for one third of global grain production. Research progress on major crops will lead to large-scale technology application, and thus tremendously benefit all people. In the near future, agriculture will face more challenges from growing population,  increasing environmental concerns, and climate change. As a response, in the long term, we are committed to developing cutting-edge technologies to help implement a productive and sustainable strategy in agriculture development.
